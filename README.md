**Interview IQ** is a placement-readiness engine designed to kill "knowledge decay." By merging the **Spaced Repetition** of Anki, the **Gamified Microlearning** of Duolingo, and the **Peer Simulations** of Pramp, we ensure you stay "Interview Ready" 365 days a year.

## 🚀 The Core Vision
Most candidates suffer from the **Forgetting Curve**—forgetting core logic weeks after solving a problem. Interview IQ isn't just a practice tool; it's a **retention system.**

* 📉 **Monitor Skill Decay:** Tracks how long it’s been since you solved a specific pattern (e.g., Sliding Window).
* 🧠 **Active Recovery:** Triggers high-intensity recall drills before you forget.
* 🤝 **Failure Analysis:** Uses peer feedback from mock interviews to identify if your weakness is **Logic**, **Communication**, or **Optimization**.

## 🏗️ The Science Behind the System

We’ve engineered this platform using proven learning mechanisms:

### 1. Retention Engine (Inspired by Anki & Duolingo)

* **Spaced Repetition:** We use a modified **SM-2 Algorithm** to schedule reviews. Hard concepts appear daily; mastered ones appear monthly.
* **Skill Trees:** Your knowledge is mapped. If you don't practice, your "Skill Nodes" start to crack (decay).

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Integration (Inspired by Pramp)
* **Live Simulations:** Match with peers for 1:1 sessions.
* **Symmetry:** You act as both the interviewer and the candidate to see both sides of the table.

## 🛠️ Key Features

| Feature | Logic | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Decay Dashboard** | Spaced Repetition | Prevents "cramming" before interviews. |
| **Atomic Drills** | Microlearning | 5-minute daily challenges to build a habit. |
| **Structured Feedback** | Peer Review | Turns interview failures into data-driven learning paths. |

## 📖 Research & Methodology
<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand: Learning Techniques used in Interview IQ</b></summary>

### From Duolingo:
- **Active Recall:** Forcing the brain to retrieve data rather than passive reading.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Instant correction to prevent reinforcing mistakes.
- **Gamification:** XP, streaks, and badges to maintain motivation.

### From Anki:
- **Self-Graded Feedback:** Users rate the difficulty of a task to recalibrate the algorithm.
- **Atomic Learning:** One specific fact or logic-pattern per "card" to prevent cognitive overload.

### From Pramp:
- **Real-Time Pressure:** Simulating the anxiety of a real interview.
- **Communication Training:** Ensuring technical skills are backed by clear explanations.
